# Learning JavaScript is hard! 

It's true. While some are able to pick it up faster than others, some still struggle. And daily professionals still need to Stackoverflow even the simpliest of concepts sometimes. 

Some may say, 

> JavaScript is easy, anyone can do it!

Or even worse ...

> You don't need to learn JavaScript to use React?

Ugh, that one is the worst. So here it is. This is a simple repository that is designed to help learn the basic concepts of how JavaScript works. 

## How does this work?

Simple really ... I post a question to be answered and you submit a pull request with the answer. 

Form the repo and with each answer submit a pull request with an answer. 

Right or wrong, the answer can be reviewed and feedback will be provided. Once the question is answered correctly, the pull request will be approved and we will move onto the next question. 

## How long will it take?

Dunno? I don't care if it goes on for months. What I care about is learning. If you don't know something today, by starting today, this time in the next few months you will know more stuff. 

## What will be the questions? 

In the beginning I wil start out slow. Almost annoyingly slow. But there is a reason for this. Even Danielson didn't understand Mister Miyagi's teachings at first ...

But guess what? After a few days of waxing those damn cars, Danielson was still an asshole ... but I digress. Over time the questions will get harder and more obscure, just like JavaScript. We'll go from things like, "What is a Variable and tell me the difference between `var`, `let` and `const` all the way up to "Let's build npm packages!"

So, are you in? Then FORK THIS REPO!
